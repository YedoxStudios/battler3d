# Imagine3D
Imagine3D is a 3D sandbox game that is heavily inspired from [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net) and [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).
Imagine3D is written in Java and uses [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) library for the graphics stuff.

- Multiplayer support
- Provides a very compact I3Lua SDK which contains several I3Lua modules required for I3Lua-based Imagine3D modules
- Server side scripting using I3lua for Servers
